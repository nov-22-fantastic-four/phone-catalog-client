    <img src="./src/images/Sass.svg" alt="Sass" width="20" height="20">
      Sass
  </h2>
  <p>
    In our project, we utilized Sass with modules for improved modularity, reusability, readability, and efficiency in our stylesheets. By breaking our stylesheets into smaller, more organized modules, we were able to more easily manage and maintain our codebase, reuse common styles across various pages and components, and write more efficient and readable code.

   <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">
    <img src="./src/images/React-icon.svg.png" alt="React" width="20" height="20">
      React
  </h2>
  <p>
    In our project, we used React with modular components to achieve improved modularity, reusability, readability, and efficiency in our UI code. This approach involved leveraging React's component-based architecture to break our UI components into smaller, more organized modules, allowing for easier management and maintenance of the codebase, and more efficient and readable code. Ultimately, this approach enabled us to build a more scalable and adaptable user interface.

    <img src="./src/images/Typescript.svg" alt="TypeScript" width="20" height="20">
      TypeScript
  </h2>
  <p>
    By allowing us to add typings to our project, TypeScript increased the predictability and decreased the chances of errors in our code. This improved code maintainability and readability, made the developer experience more positive, and enhanced our mood.

  <p>
    Thanks to ClickUp, we were able to avoid task distribution issues right from the start of the project. With this tool, we had a clear overview of every step that needed to be taken, which allowed us to work efficiently and confidently. We were able to keep track of each other's progress, control tasks, and work effectively as a team.

    <img src="./src/images/Prisma.png" alt="Prisma" width="20" height="20">
      Prisma
  </h2>
  <p>
    We incorporated Prisma in our project, which streamlined our database management and facilitated efficient ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) operations. With Prisma, we were able to interact with the database using a type-safe and intuitive API, simplifying the development process and reducing the potential for errors.
